Revision history for Perl extension DBIx-Transaction.

1.100   2009/09/17
        - New feature: Ability to re-run a transaction if it fails
          (really, ability to re-run a transaction whenever you want...)
        - Updated most errors to use DBI's errstr() system instead of
          croaking. The only exception is this new retry feature, becuase
          DBI like's to wipe out it's error condition when the rollback
          happens...

1.003   2009/08/19
        - Apply a patch from Toru Yamaguchi (http://search.cpan.org/~zigorou/)
          to support DBI's "RootClass" attribute.

1.002   2008/01/22
        - Return errors from the perspective of the caller.

1.001   2008/01/17
        - Retain the error string as well as the caller if there is an error.

1.000   2008/01/17
        - Make "execute()" log who called it if there is an error.

0.008   2006/03/13
        - Get rid of our META.yml. It's confusing too many automated
          testers!

0.007   2006/02/24
        - Got rid of Test::CPANpm test for now, we need a better
          system to detect automated testing, etc.
        - Perl 5.6.1 always returns a scalar value for do();
          changed test_opts.ph to be compatible with that.
        - When a transaction error or subtransaction rollback
          occurs, then a commit happens later, make the error that
          comes from commit() display the file name and line number
          of the original error.

0.006   2006/01/16
        - Added debugging to Makefile.t to see why our AUTOMATED_TESTING
          variable isn't being passed along.

0.005   2006/01/13
        - After discussion on <dbi-users@perl.org> and <perl-qa@perl.org>,
          switch to only depending on DBD::SQLite2 if AUTOMATED_TESTING
          is set: that way, smoke testers need it to get a green light on
          testers.cpan.org, but end users don't.

0.004   2006/01/11
        - Use DBI_DSN for the default testing DSN, if available
        - Make automated testing more reliable by depending on DBD::SQLite2
          if we're testing against it, since it's the default.

0.003   2005/12/30
        - Added a new "transaction()" convienence method which
          runs a block of code inside a transaction. (db.pm)

0.002   2005/11/30
        - Made do() and execute() poison a transaction if there is an
          error. This is the "lowest common denominator" DBMS behaviour
          so enforcing it here makes all DBMS have the same error behaviour
          (one error ruins the whole transaction) when running under
          DBIx::Transaction.

0.001   2005/11/25
        - Initial public release
